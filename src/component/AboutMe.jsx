          I am originally from Korea and arrived in Manchester March, 2019. I
          came to the UK as it has been my dream since I was a teenager work and
          live here. In Korea I studied Economics at University and I then
          worked as a HR assistant for Hyundai for around 2 years. I am
          determined to make my dream come true so in February 2019 I quit my
          job in Korea and came all the way here to the UK.

          My interest in coding first started last year through a conversation I
          had with one of my customers who works in the IT industry. We talked
          about what coding was and how quickly the industry is growing.
          Following that conversation I started to do my own research into the
          field and joined meet ups such as ‘code up’ and ‘code and stuff’. From
          there my interest grew and grew. Coding was not something I ever
          imagined my self doing and a subject I had very little knowledge on
          until recently. However, after spending time speaking with people from
          the industry, attending meet ups, watching hours of youtube videos,
          studying via online classes and practicing at home, I have found
          something that I am incredibly passionate about. I have recently
          graduated bootcamp in Northcoders, and since then I have been kept
          studying about software development.
