          I am originally from Korea. I came to the UK as it has been my dream
          since I was a teenager work and live here. In Korea I studied
          Economics at University and I then worked as a HR assistant for
          Hyundai for around 2 years. I am determined to make my dream come true
          so in February 2019 I quit my job in Korea and came all the way here
          to the UK.

          My interest in coding first started last year through a conversation I
          had with one of my customers who works in the IT industry. We talked
          about what coding was and how quickly the industry is growing.
          Following that conversation I started to do my own research into the
          field and joined meet ups such as ‚Äòcode up‚Äô and ‚Äòcode and stuff‚Äô.From
          there my interest grew and grew.

          Coding was not something I ever imagined my self doing and a subject I
          had very little knowledge on. However, after spending time speaking
          with people from the industry, attending meet ups, watching hours of
          youtube videos, studying via online classes and practicing at home, I
          have found something that I am incredibly passionate about. Then I
          decided to join full-time bootcamp, Northcoders. During 2 months in bootcamp
          I gained knowledge of fundamental javascript, Test-driven
          development, Object-oriented programming,RESTful API, CRUD operations.
          In Northcoders, I only learnt about front-end side so since I graduated,
          I was focus to teach myself about backend and study about Responsive web site with Freecodecamp where I get my certification.
          and recapping a lot of things that I learn in bootcamp. To keep my routine Northcoders form 9 to 5 I am
          also doing 100days of code challenge in my twitter. Now I am looking
          for my next journey as developer. and I am ready to pour all my passion!!!‚ú®
