          I am originally from Korea. I came to Manchester as it has been my
          dream since I was a teenager to work and live in the UK. In Korea, I
          studied Economics at University and I then worked as an HR assistant
          for Hyundai for around 2 years. I am determined to make my dream come
          true so in February 2019 I quit my job in Korea and came all the way
          here to the UK.

          My interest in coding first started at the end of 2019 through a conversation I
          had with a customer at my bar job who works in the IT industry. We
          talked about what coding was and how quickly the industry is growing.
          Following that conversation, I started to do my research into the
          field and joined meetups such as ‚Äòcode up‚Äô and ‚Äòcode and stuff‚Äô. From
          there my interest grew and grew. 
          I met amazing people at meet ups and received a lot of help from mentors and I want to be a mentor soon so that I can help people who want to be in the tech industry.

          Coding was not something I ever imagined myself doing and a subject I
          had very little knowledge on. However, after spending time speaking
          with people from the industry, attending meetups, watching hours of
          youtube videos, studying via online classes, and practicing at home, I
          have found something that I am incredibly passionate about. April 2019, I
          joined a full-time boot camp, Northcoders. Joining boot camp was not easy decision to make 
          but I was certain that this was the path that I wanted to take. In boot camp,
          I gained knowledge of fundamental JavaScript, test-driven development,
          object-oriented programming, RESTful API and CRUD operations and React.<br></br><br></br>

          In Northcoders, our focus of the study was front-end development so since graduating my focus has been on learning backend. 
          When I start studying backend, it was daunting as I was self-studying but I have managed to make MERN stack applications. 
          The more I learn, the more my passion grows. 
          I also finished doing the 100 days of code challenge on Twitter after graduating from Northcoders to keep my routine of studying from 9 to 5. 
          (Check to see my journey on Twitter!) During this challenge, I get to know a lot of like minded people and have been inspired greatly by them. 
          January 2021, I started another journey with QA, which is UK's leading tech skills organisation. 
          Luckily I received funds from GMCA after successfully completing pre learning. So far I have been learning about Agile methods, 
          Cloud computing with Google Cloud Platform, CI/ CD, MySQL, Python and Flask. I am building my first project in QA at the moment with the technologies that I have learned so far. 
          Next, I am looking for my next journey as a full stack developer.
